Container: It can be created using any containerization platform. For example, in my case, I used Docker. We just need to use the docker run command in the command line interface, 
and the container will be created, allowing us to access the application or process inside the container

Pods: More or less, pods are similar to Docker containers, but in pods, we can have one or more containers that are tightly coupled and share the same network.

If we observe, both containers and pods are similar, but there are slight differences between them. However, neither of them can solve auto-scaling and auto-healing issues.

Deployments: Actual Hero of k8s that solves both auto healing and auto scaling.
