RBAC(Role Based ACCESS Controller)

Whenever we create secrets, we use RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) because the principle of least privilege allows us to restrict access to the secrets effectively.

RBAC is directly related to security and is classified into two types: 1) Users and 2) Service Accounts.

User: Defines the access a user should have on the cluster to prevent actions like deletion and overwriting.

Service Accounts: Similar to user management, service accounts allow us to manage the access of services or resources, such as pods and deployments, that are running in the cluster.

In Kubernetes, there are three components for managing RBAC: 1) User/Service Accounts, 2) Role, and 3) Role Binding.

Role: Specifies what access a user or service account should have.

Role Binding: Used to attach roles to users and manage service accounts.

Roles handle permissions, while role bindings manage the assignment of those permissions."
