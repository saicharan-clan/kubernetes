Configmaps and Secrets are use to store the information

We store sensitive data in secrets and non-sensitive data in configmaps, which can later be used by pods and deployments. As we know, cluster information is stored in etcd, so anyone with access to the cluster or
etcd could compromise the data. Therefore, we store sensitive information in secrets and non-sensitive information in configmaps. If we put any data in a secret, It encrypts that data at rest before the 
object is saved in etcd. We can also use custom encryption methods. Both configmaps and secrets store data as key-value pairs.

We store that data in environment variables and volumes. When using environment variables, there's an issue: whenever we update the variable, we need to restart the service or container for the changes to take effect. 
However, with volumes, the data can be updated without requiring a restart. So we prefer volumes for storing data.
